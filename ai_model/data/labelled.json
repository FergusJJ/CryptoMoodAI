It ultimately favours the wealthy who can hold and dont need to spend.\nMining (proof of stake or work) allow the wealthy to invest in mining equipment to control or dominate the market.\nUltimately, no government on earth is going to give up its monetary policy as that is a key lever of control.\nessentially everyone involved at this point is just trying to hustle the next generation - any hope any of it would serve as a useful technological or financial system has gone)\nthe massive mis-represnetaion of how bitcoin in particular works, despite claims, it does not offer any of the following:\nanonymity - the entire blockchain is public and diligently recorded on millions of nodes\ndistributed freedom - a small number of mining cartels control almost all the hash power and normal people use one of ten crypto currency exchanges for everything anyway\nunencumbered transactions - it's comically slow and inefficient\nconvenient purchases - wallets are unwieldly for normal people, no reversibility\nstore of value - volatility is hilarious and all anyone cares about us BTC:USD\nthings I do like about cryptocurrency:\n\nmonero is pretty clever\nethereum smart contracts are pretty scifi\nwatching people learn 5000 years of history of why we have banking regulation in a single decade has been fun\nthere will be some massive financial catastrophes to watch that will mostly only harm people who did not read my previous list\nthe earlier state of every single exchange either getting robbed or exit scamming their own fanboys was quite funny in retrospect\n(thx to u/TwentyCharactersShor for some extra items).\n\nI used to just think cryptocurrency was a fun hack but a bad idea for the mainstream, but I'm now pretty convinced it should be banned purely on resource grounds, since it seems impossible to force the externalities to be addressed\n\nIt's possible that someone will invent a cryptocurrency that's efficient to a level that it's not morally reprehensible to use, but how would it take off? the existing cryptocurrency interests want bitcoin to succeed purely because they're the top of the pyramid and also selling the shovels and so now anything new has to compete aginst the real financial sector and the entrenched cryptocurrency players.",

It is reasonable to expect the long term average growth rate of Bitcoin to stay very high for the foreseeable future.\n\nReal estate has significant holding costs (eg: taxes, maintenance, insurance, sometimes fees, interest). Real estate isn't very liquid, and it has extremely high transaction costs.\n\nUltimately, the price of real estate (and rents) is limited by incomes. For example, in the long run people can't pay more for mort./rent than they earn. Realistically, they might be able to afford 35 or 40 percent of their net income for \"a place to live\". Thus, real estate prices are limited by incomes, in the long run. Incomes tend to barely keep up with inflation.\n\nLooking at long term historical data, such as Case-Shiller, for popular real estate markets, we see, in fact, that real estate prices barely track the rate of inflation, especially when the significant holding costs are properly accounted for.\n\nBitcoin has no such limit. Bitcoin has no holding costs. Bitcoin is liquid. Bitcoin transactions are typically very little. Bitcoin's price has been more than doubling every year, long term average, and as mentioned before, can reasonably be expected to continues its rapid ascent.\n\nReal estate is currently in a bubble, as evidenced by the price-to-income ratios.

Real estate is a sitting duck for higher taxes. Real estate can be confiscated.\n\nWhen the private keys are properly stored, Bitcoin cannot be confiscated.\n\nKnowing all this, a person would be a total idiot to purchase real estate instead of investing in Bitcoin.\n\nHaving said that, I do plan on eventually using a small fraction (about 10 or 15 percent) of my Bitcoin holdings to buy my dream home - and to pay for it with Bitcoin, but still end up sitting on a serious stack of sats.\n\nI have zero regrets for investing in Bitcoin instead of real estate, and I never will."

The same way the stock market or any asset can be a hedge against inflation. It usually counts on you selling as inflation happens not during the fallout after - crypto preformed extremely well in the last two years during the run up of the (lagging) CPI.\n\nEthereum is a hedge against inflation because people spend $20-80 million for its blockspace each DAY. It mints $30M in new coins which get sold each day to people who want blockspace. Next year it will mint $3M new coins each day forever after, and I'm taking the bet people will pay even more for blockspace in the future (by L2 compression protocols that batch 1000s into 1). Blockspace is finate and demand is strong, it's been a good bet to make so far.\n\nHere's a great site to compare POW and POS Ethereum. Something like a 2000x energy reduction sometime this year.\n\nBitcoin mining is done on specialized hardware so the economics of that are a lot different than GPU mining, and very strongly incentivize the new development of clean power. IMO large corporations having access to ~$0 energy while selling it for a cost isn't sustainable for true decentralization but whatever, it keeps coal mines from being profitable too if the hashrate can be inexpensively high.\nThe argument against it usually is that it allows existing mines to stay open longer by recycling their otherwise wasted energy into BTC which means they may not go bankrupt. That's still a step in the right direction compared to flaring it all into the sky though, and that BTC can be sent somewhere that has no power to create power (like oil is used).\n\nEvery 4 years the amount of new BTC minted per block is reduced by half, and the hashrate (security/difficulty to mine) is dependant on how many miners are trying to get the one block reward. That means if your costs 20K to mine a BTC that's worth 30K today, the next halving your costs will be 20K to receive 15K of BTC, and you would be forced to stop mining or find a cheaper alternative. If the price of BTC doubles than you are safe but (despite what btc maxis think) it can't double forever. It's a non-issue because it will solve itself. Ideally the costs from people buying blockspace (crypto fees) will be drastic enough to make up for today's prehalving inflation rate, which means a ton of POW being done to earn fees - but if today miners are already making the pivot to clean energy (and not by choice) I can't imagine in ~20 years it being any easier to use coal or otherwise.\n\nThe energy argument is a global one, picking just crypto is disingenuous because most people are completely ignorant about crypto so this is what they're taught. BTC is a legitimate currency in multiple Countries, crypto is used all over the world in places that don't have banks or face real inflation (Argentina), I spend it on cards in shops with and online too, VISA is using it because it's cheaper/faster than their existing rails, so is Stripe for the same reason. Volitility means you buy at the price you deserve not the price told to you, if housing bounced up and down every 4y and you weren't forced into a $1M two bedroom home maybe you'd be okay with it?\n\nThere are real problems with crypto but none of the things you mentioned.\n"

This is why:\nPOLITICS\nI used to think that Bitcoin Cash was a traitor and to be avoided at all costs. I thought, how can anyone trust an ecosystem if Bitcoin, the #1 coin that everyone holds and believes in ends up being dethroned? Why would anyone invest in this space if King BTC is no more? These were my thoughts in 2017 up until just the other day...\n\n\n\nNow, I have come to terms that BCH is not just a copy and paste clone of Bitcoin. Every single Bitcoin holder on the planet received an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash because it was a forked from Bitcoin. This means that even if Bitcoin Cash became the #1 cryptocurrency, that Bitcoin holders have no one to blame but themselves if they don't own an equal portion of Bitcoin Cash... it was given to them for free! I guess the more and more I have thought about it, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin because it has the same previous transaction history and literally everyone holding Bitcoin received an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash, this was no money grab.\n\nBitcoin may or may not scale with its small blocksize. We should be thanking Bitcoin Cash for being created to give a counter argument to see if increasing the blocksize ends up being good for scalability and fees. And if it ends up being the #1 cryptocurrency because of this, who cares, everyone holding Bitcoin during the time of the fork holds an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash, and if they don't, then that is on them.\n\n\n\nNot sure why it took me 3 years to have this epiphany, but I did and wanted to share. What are your thoughts on Bitcoin Cash?"

This is why:\nPOLITICS\nI used to think that Bitcoin Cash was a traitor and to be avoided at all costs. I thought, how can anyone trust an ecosystem if Bitcoin, the #1 coin that everyone holds and believes in ends up being dethroned? Why would anyone invest in this space if King BTC is no more? These were my thoughts in 2017 up until just the other day...\n\n\n\nNow, I have come to terms that BCH is not just a copy and paste clone of Bitcoin. Every single Bitcoin holder on the planet received an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash because it was a forked from Bitcoin. This means that even if Bitcoin Cash became the #1 cryptocurrency, that Bitcoin holders have no one to blame but themselves if they don't own an equal portion of Bitcoin Cash... it was given to them for free! I guess the more and more I have thought about it, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin because it has the same previous transaction history and literally everyone holding Bitcoin received an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash, this was no money grab.\n\nBitcoin may or may not scale with its small blocksize. We should be thanking Bitcoin Cash for being created to give a counter argument to see if increasing the blocksize ends up being good for scalability and fees. And if it ends up being the #1 cryptocurrency because of this, who cares, everyone holding Bitcoin during the time of the fork holds an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash, and if they don't, then that is on them.\n\n\n\nNot sure why it took me 3 years to have this epiphany, but I did and wanted to share. What are your thoughts on Bitcoin Cash?",

Lo an behold, I have come to realise that the \"coins\" I had for past few years are actually not there.. Imagine my surprise. I loaded $100 into my jaxx wallet a few years ago just because why not? Well thankfull it was only $100 because ofcourse I lost it. My wallet is stuck on 'initializing' whatever that means and I cant do anything: https://ibb.co/7Xv0NF1\n\nNever has a bank just lost my money like that. Crypto is the biggest fucking scam in the universe. Get out of it while you still can.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nOk so winzupdatee showed me how to fix my crap assbitcoin and as promised, I sent him 0.001btc as well as my fav answer from previous post dispite not being convinced. So to whoever said I wasnt going to pay up, I forgive you.\n\nALSO, this experience has only reinforced my distrust of crypto. I paid almost TEN DOLLARS to transfer like 40. THATS A 25% FEE LOL. How the hell can anyone advocate for a service that takes more fees than private lender banks for interest? Yea I get it, you can anonymously send money anywhere instantly, but apart from this dumb excercise on reddit, I cant fathom any reason or use for this especially not a \"store of value\".

My wallet is stuck on 'initializing' whatever that means and I cant do anything: https://ibb.co/7Xv0NF1\n\nNever has a bank just lost my money like that. Crypto is the biggest fucking scam in the universe. Get out of it while you still can.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nOk so winzupdatee showed me how to fix my crap assbitcoin and as promised, I sent him 0.001btc as well as my fav answer from previous post dispite not being convinced. So to whoever said I wasnt going to pay up, I forgive you.\n\nALSO, this experience has only reinforced my distrust of crypto. I paid almost TEN DOLLARS to transfer like 40. THATS A 25% FEE LOL. How the hell can anyone advocate for a service that takes more fees than private lender banks for interest? Yea I get it, you can anonymously send money anywhere instantly, but apart from this dumb excercise on reddit, I cant fathom any reason or use for this especially not a \"store of value\". All civil and polite discussions are appreciated.",

And before crypto-bros come out of the woodwork and say that I don't understand crypto, I read the original whitepaper maybe a year or so after it came out and have kept reasonably well informed on crypto stuff since then.\n\nEarly days bitcoin was kind of interesting but it pretty quickly became apparent that it could never function as a consumer currency. If Bitcoin attempted to process even 1% of the transactions that AMEX does in a day it would take weeks to verify a transaction. So if it can't be used a a currency WTF is it? People started pointing out that gold is largely worthless except as an agreed store of value so they said 'well can't Bitcoin be that?' No, of course it can't. Gold has physical substance and the backing of nation states, it's value is protected by legal and social institutions. Yeah, all money is fake but Bitcoin is the fakest of all.\n\nAt the end of the day all crypto is worthless until you can find someone to trade you actual fiat currency for it, because it can't be used to fucking buy anything! That means that all crypto is just a 'bagholder' scam it works as long as the next idiot comes along to hold the bag. Fundamentally, it is no different from the holofoil comic book covers that almost destroyed the comics industry in the speculative bubble of the 90's, except there's a level of exposure the size of a small western European country.
